## [Collision and Citation Data Project](https://github.com/sedenl/Collision-and-Citation-Data-Project)
- Montgomery County Parking Citation Data and the Maryland Crash Data were used for this project.
- Loaded data into dataframe and cleaned data.
- Performed exploratory data analysis on both datasets.
- Analyzed both datasets to answer my hypothesis that there would be more crashes and citations during the winter than other seasons.
- Answered the question of if there was a correlation between crashes and citations in Montgomery County by finding the Pearson correlation coefficient and creating a heat map to visualize these results.
